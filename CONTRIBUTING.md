# Contributing to FlashString

If you make any modifications or additions to this library, please consider sharing them
so that others may benefit.

If you have an idea but not sure how to implement it, raise an issue.

You can submit changes via [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/mikee47/FlashString/pulls).

Please consider the following elements as part of your PR:

1. Unit testing. Does the existing test application cover your usage?
   If not, add the required test cases or a new module, if appropriate.
2. Stick to the library conventions and avoid declaring multiple classes in a single file.
3. Use clang-format in "file" mode to format the code

Thank you!
